    <h1>Getting Started with Axure RP</h1>
    <p>
      In this introductory guide, you'll learn the basics of creating and
      sharing prototypes. You’ll learn about pages, widgets, and interactions.
      You'll also learn how to view your prototypes in a web browser and share
      them with Axure Cloud.
    </p>
    <h2>Pages</h2>
    <p>
      Axure RP files are organized into pages, which you can manage in the Pages
      pane. To add a page, click the Add Page button at the top-right of the
      Pages pane. Double-click a page's name in the Pages pane to open it on the
      canvas
    </p>

    <h2>The Canvas</h2>
    <p>
      The canvas is where you'll build your designs. You can work without
      boundaries, or you can set page dimensions based on the target device
      you're designing for.
    </p>

    <h2>Widgets</h2>
    <p>
      You’ll build your designs using widgets, which are organized into
      libraries in the Libraries pane. Axure RP comes with four widget libraries
      pre-installed — Default, Flow, Icons, and Sample UI Patterns — but you can
      also create your own or add libraries created by your teammates.
    </p>

    <p>
      To add a widget to the canvas, drag it from the Libraries pane. You can
      also use the options in the Insert menu to add text, images, and shapes.
      To edit the text on a widget, double click it, or select it and press
      ENTER. To change the visual appearance of your widgets, head over to the
      Style pane. Many properties like fill color and font are also located in
      the style toolbar along the top of the canvas for quick access.
    </p>
    <h2>Interactions</h2>
    <p>
      Once you have some widgets on the canvas, you can add interactivity to
      them in the Interactions pane.
    </p>
    <h2>Link to Another Page</h2>
    <p>
      It's simple and quick to create links between pages in your prototype.

    <p>
      In the Pages pane, add a new page. You should now have two pages, Page 1
      and Page 2. On Page 1, drag a button widget onto the canvas from the
      Libraries pane. Select the button and click Click or Tap → Open Link in
      the Interactions pane. Select Page 2 in the list that appears and click
      OK. Click the Preview button at the top-right of the UI to open the
      prototype in your web browser. Click the button to go to Page 2.
    </p>
    <h2>Showing and Hiding Widgets</h2>
    <p>
      You can also dynamically show and hide widgets on the page. Learn how in
      the Hiding and Showing Widgets tutorial.

    <h2>Interactive Style Effects</h2>
    <p>
      You can use style effects to change a widget's visual appearance when it's
      moused over, clicked on, and more. Learn how in the Interactive Button
      tutorial.
    </p>
    <h2>Sharing Your Prototypes</h2>
    <p>
      When you're ready to show your work to your teammates and stakeholders,
      you can either publish to Axure Cloud for free, or to one of our private
      hosting solutions with Axure Cloud for Business. Click the Share button at
      the top-right of the UI and give your project a name and password. Then
      click Publish to get a shareable link to the hosted project.
    </p>

      Click the Share button at the top-right of the UI and give your project a
      name and password. Then click Publish to get a shareable link to the
